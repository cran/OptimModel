	Small improvements

        * The optim_fit (optim_fit.R) object now holds onto "x" as a list item. This overcomes an issue in extracting the data from the parent directory of an optim_fit               object.
        * The function residuals.optim_fit (residuals.optim_fit.R) extracts "x" from the optim_fit object for studentized residuals. It no longer calls getData().
        * The function predict.optim_fit (predict.optim_fit.R) no longer requires an argument "x". It can now extract "x" from the optim_fit object.
        * test-predict.optim_fit.R and test-residuals.optim_fit.R have been updated to reflect the above changes.
	* Removed dots (...) from argument in the residuals.optim_fit.Rd manual file
